Diferences bewteen Ipre and Nuevo intento: 
    - In ipre we had lists on the logic, that each had every single channels with every single pulse. But in N.I we have lists that have Channel instances, were each instance has its own variables, this will allow for shorter "for" loops to find the correct channel
    
idea:
    maybe a great way to turn my code to a more efficient verison is to add a  sequence class. because a channel will be constituted of many sequences. for example if our experiment consititues of 100 iterations, and we have a sequence1 between the 0-->50 iteration and a sequence2 between the 51--->100 iteration. our channel must include both of this. 

    We will also need to add the option when adding a pulse. if to add it to an specific sequence of the channel or to the whole channel

Mayor change:
    Before we used to add pulses to the whole channel, now when adding a pulse we must select between which iterations the pulse is added to and how it varies per iteration. We could also
